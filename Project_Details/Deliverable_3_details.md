Deliverable 3 Submission (30% as 20% group and 10% individual)
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Deadline: 4pm Friday 22 October (week 12).**

**Submit** Deliverable 3a (submit 1 document per team) and Deliverable 3b (submit 1 document per team member) in [**cssubmit**](https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/cssubmit). Make sure you choose the correct submission area for each part. Each submission should be a single **pdf document**. No zip, rar, word or other formats please. Your submission can include references to additional documents in your github repository as required.

_A capstone subject \[should\] assess the quality of artefacts and the quality of the methods of their creation, so demonstrating achievement of both technical outcomes and of professional skills such as project management, leadership and teamwork._ \[ACS accreditation criteria\] Deliverable 3 focusses on these quality aspects. By the end of week 12 you should submit Deliverable 3 comprising:

***   The working system, Source code hosted on a shared GitHub repository and User manual for the system (20% group)
*   Video presentation (10% individual)**

#### Deliverable 3a: Final Project (submit 1 per team)

Deliverable 3a should demonstrate that you have

1.  Delivered your project as quality code that runs, has been tested and is appropriately documented.
2.  Delivered supporting documentation for the functions you developed including automated test cases, user manual and any other training material.
3.  Interacted with team members, the client and other stakeholders for system delivery. Performed a formal hand over of the system and its GitHub repository to the client.

##### Client Review (will be requested by the unit coordinator)

The project client will be asked (by the unit coordinator) to complete a short survey on the project. Their feedback will contribute to your mark for Deliverable 3a. You should ensure that the team has met with your client to demonstrate and hand over your project code and for approval of project documents before you submit Deliverable 3. This feedback will be requested from the client by the unit coordinator after the submission deadline.

#### Deliverable 3b: Video Presentation (submit 1 per team member)

Each team member will create a video presentation (screen capture or talking to camera) of the project. This will be no more than 10 minutes long and will review the project, demonstrate the software and discuss what future plans could be. You should also reflect on and discuss what worked and didn't work with the entire project. Although there will be overlap in the topics covered by each member, the team is encouraged to identify focus areas for each member's video.

#### Marking Criteria

The marking criteria for 30 marks are as follows. Each component will be assessed on whether

1.  it is clear and logically laid out
2.  it meets the deliverable requirements given
3.  it describes and justifies any assumptions made.

Maximum marks for a criterion, eg 5/5, will only be awarded sparingly.
