Deliverable 1 Submission (15% as 10% group and 5% individual)
-------------------------------------------------------------

**Deadline: 4pm Friday 27 August (week 5).**

**Submit** Deliverable 1a (submit 1 document per team) and Deliverable 1b (submit 1 document per team member) in [**cssubmit**](https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/cssubmit). Make sure you choose the correct submission area for each part. Each submission should be a single **pdf document**. No zip, rar, word or other formats please. Your submission can include references to additional documents in your github repository as required.

_For IT, the primary focus is on technology, closely aligned with user goals_ \[ACM curriculum 2020\]. Deliverable 1 focusses on these two aspects. By the end of week 5 you should submit Deliverable 1 comprising:

***   Group project specification document (10% group)
*   Individual reflection on group process (5% individual)**

#### Deliverable 1a Group project specification

The group shall prepare documentation to support the development of the project. It is up to each group to decide on the presentation of this document. The deliverable shall include a functional specification that details what you have been asked to build. The format of this document can take a number of accepted forms - modeling diagrams, use cases, user stories, explicitly stated functional requirements (in the form of "the system shall"). The group shall also consider and document project scope, your group's skills, resources, and project risks. The deliverable shall shall include a realistic plan for completing the project.

Deliverable 1a should demonstrate that you have

1.  Interacted with the client and other stakeholders to identify and prioritise their requirements and scope for the project
2.  Considered the group's skills, resources and project risks
3.  Investigated technology choices for this project and selected appropriate development environment, languages, and technologies for your project.
4.  Demonstrated to the client an initial prototype for the software product. This could include code, web pages, database frames etc. You could also include screen mockups etc.
5.  Made and agreed a plan for the project completion, with sufficient detail to complete deliverable 2.

Remember that agile methodologies "preference _brevity_ over _long documents_" \[agilemanifesto.org/principles.html\]. But project success also requires that you have considered the options for this project carefully, and that important decisions are documented. Provide references to project documents in your github repository to help with this. For example, reference your meeting minutes and report the agreed outcomes as a feature list for (1) and (2). For example, reference meeting minutes or other documents showing formal rationale arguments for your technology choices for (3).

##### Client Review (will be requested by the unit coordinator)

The project client will be asked (by the unit coordinator) to complete a short survey on the work done so far. Their feedback will contribute to your mark for Deliverable 1a. You should ensure that you have met with your client to demonstrate your prototype and approve project documents before you submit Deliverable 1. This feedback will be requested from the client by the unit coordinator after the submission deadline.

#### Deliverable 1b: Individual reflection on group process (submit 1 per team member)

An important aspect of iterative development methods is reflection: \`\`At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly." \[agilemanifesto.org/principles.html\] Before submitting this deliverable, each member of the team shall write a short (1 page) individual reflection on the team process so far: what went well, what could be improved and how to improve it. The team shall discuss these individual reflections in a meeting, and identify any changes to be made to your working methods or team charter. This team meeting to consider the reflections should be documented in the normal way. See the CATME web pages for useful templates and other resources. Give a reference to the team meeting document at the end of your reflection submission.

#### Marking Criteria

The marking criteria for 15 marks are as follows. Each component will be assessed on whether

1.  it is clear and logically laid out
2.  it meets the deliverable requirements given
3.  it describes and justifies any assumptions made.

Maximum marks for a criterion, eg 3/3, will only be awarded sparingly.

Deliverable 1a (group) (10 marks)

1.  Evidence of good communications with the client and other stakeholders; client is satisfied with prototype demonstration and other deliverables to date (3 marks)
2.  The team has made a realistic assessment of skills, resources and risks. Skills gaps have been identified and addressed. (2 marks)
3.  The team has carefully considered different choices of technology for the project and clearly justified the decisions made. (3 marks)
4.  Project plan is realistic and contains sufficient detail to complete the next deliverable. Responsibilities and deadlines are documented. (2 marks)

Deliverable 1b Reflection (individual) (5 marks)

1.  Individual reflection gives succinct and insightful reflections on the project process. (3 marks)
2.  Evidence that team has reviewed these insights and identified process improvements for the next deliverable. (2 marks)
