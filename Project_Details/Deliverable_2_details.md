# Deliverable 2 Submission (25% individual)

**Deadline: 4pm Friday 24 September (week 8).**

**Submit** Deliverable 2a (submit 1 document per team member) and Deliverable 2b (submit 1 document per team member) in cssubmit. Make sure you choose the correct submission area for each part. Each submission should be a single pdf document. No zip, rar, word or other formats please. Your submission can include references to additional documents in your github repository as required.


Agile software projects aim to Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. and assert that Working software is the primary measure of progress. [agilemanifesto.org/principles.html]. Deliverable 2 focusses on these two aspects.

For Deliverable 2 individuals will focus on delivery of specific features of the project, and on integration of these features into the main group project. The team will need to collaborate on allocating features to individuals and ensuring that each deliverable integrates well with the full system. But each tean member will submit their own code for their contributed features. By the end of week 9 you should submit Deliverable 2 comprising:

### 1.Running, tested, integrated and documented source code for your feature(s) (20% individual)

### 2.Individual reflection on group process (5% individual)

<hr>

##Deliverable 2a: Project features (submit 1 per team member)


Each group member shall deliver code, tests, and documentation for one or more software features they have developed for the project. Submit a summary document that gives links to your code, meetings, tests and any other relevant documentation.
Deliverable 2a should demonstrate that you have

1.Built functionality for the project and delivered this as quality code that runs, has been tested and is appropriately documented.

2.Contributed supporting documentation for the functions you developed such as a user manual or other training material.

3.Interacted with team members, the client and other stakeholders to check their needs and integrate your components with the main project.

4.Followed the group's project plan (which should have allocated particular functionalities to different team members) and been able to adapt that plan if necessary, with clear communication to the group and client. Updated the project plan as required for the next project iteration.

As for deliverable 1, remember that agile methodologies "preference brevity over long documents" [agilemanifesto.org/principles.html]. Provide references to project documents in your github repository to help with this.

### Client Review (will be requested by the unit coordinator)

The project client will be asked (by the unit coordinator) to complete a short survey on the work done so far. Their feedback will contribute to your mark for Deliverable 2a. You should ensure that the team has met with your client to demonstrate your integrated features and for approval of project documents before you submit Deliverable 2. This feedback will be requested from the client by the unit coordinator after the submission deadline.

## Deliverable 2b: Individual reflection on group process (submit 1 per team member)

An important aspect of iterative development methods is reflection: At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly." [agilemanifesto.org/principles.html] Before submitting this deliverable, each member of the team shall write a short (1 page) individual reflection on the team process so far: what went well, what could be improved and how to improve it. The team shall discuss these individual reflections in a meeting, and identify any changes to be made to your working methods or team charter. This team meeting to consider the reflections should be documented in the normal way. See the CATME web pages for useful templates and other resources. Give a reference to the team meeting document at the end of your reflection submission.

## Marking Criteria


The marking criteria for 25 marks are as follows. Each component will be assessed on whether

1.it is clear and logically laid out

2.it meets the deliverable requirements given

3.it describes and justifies any assumptions made.

Maximum marks for a criterion, eg 3/3, will only be awarded sparingly.

### Deliverable 2a Project Features (individual) (20 marks)

1.Overall quality of project features: Submitted code can be run smoothly for demonstration; Acceptance tests are agreed, runnable and the code passes these tests; New features are integrated with the full project. (10 marks)

2.Overall quality of user/system documentation: Sufficient information for marker (or client) to run the system and test new functionality; Demonstrated progress on documentation required for the final project delivery. (4 marks)

3.Evidence of effective testing and integration of code (eg. github commits); Evidence of client and stakeholder and team review of the code. (3 marks)

4.Extent to which the planned goals for Deliverable 2 were met. Ability to communicate with the team and adjust plans as required. An updated realistic plan is provided for the final iteration of the project. (3 marks)

### Deliverable 2b Reflection (individual) (5 marks)

1.Individual reflection gives succinct and insightful reflections on the project process. (3 marks)

2.Evidence that team has reviewed these insights and identified process improvements for the next deliverable. (2 marks)
